# kelda-demo

This is a playground project to demonstrate the usage of [Kelda.js](https://github.com/rufusraghunath/kelda) in enhancing the performance of UIs. It also includes a demonstration of other optimization strategies (i.e. virtualized scroll and lazy state calculation) that can be used before Kelda becomes necessary.
